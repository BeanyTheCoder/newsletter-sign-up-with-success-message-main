## My process 🏗️

### Built with 🛠️

- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript(Regex and Form Validation)

### What I learned 🧠

I learned a bit on form validation, specifically regular expressions(_regex_) and how to handle form submits

```js
// some simple regex code, that selects every character from A-Z:
let regex = ([A-Z])\
```

Also learned the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudoclasses, which I never knew existed!

```css
input:valid {
  color: green;
}

input:invalid {
  color: red;
}
```

### Continued development 🚀
